# SVF_from_Pointclouds
In this github repository you can calculate sky view factor directly from pointcloud data instead of digital elevation models

This project calculates the Sky View Factor (SVF) for a point cloud dataset. It includes:

- Loading and preprocessing point clouds.
- Calculating SVF using Python and visualization of results.
- Saving point cloud data with SVF as attributes for 3D visualization.

## How to Use
- Run the main Python scripts in a Python 3.8+ environment.
- Requirements: `open3d`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`.
- See the example in the `main.py` file for usage.
